# ProjectJavaLibrary

The project aims to manage daily activities in a single library.

A variety of books can be borrowed from this library. Every book has a unique code, a title, an author, a genre, a number of pages. It is also known if a book is available or not (it is currently borrowed or not by someone else). 

There are several customers, identified by code, name, number of books borrowed over time, a return date for the currently borrowed book. A customer can borrow only one book at a time. The clients of this library are of two types: students, who additionally have the faculty and year of study defined, and teachers, who additionally have a taught subject. There cannot be two customers with the same name.
